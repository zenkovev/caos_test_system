(Enter cautiously, almost on tiptoe, AMMOS FYODOROVICH (the Judge), ARTMI PHILIPPOVICH (the Charity Commissioner), the POSTMASTER, LUKA LUKICH, DOBCHINSKI, and BOBCHINSKI, all in full gala uniform. The whole scene is played in an undertone.)
JUDGE (arranging them all in a semicircle). For God's sake, gentlemen, form your circle quicker; let's have better order ! Good heavens he goes to Court, you know, and bullies the Council of State ! Draw up in military order, absolutely in military order ! Peter Ivanovich, you must stand there ! (Both BOBCHINSKI and DOBCHINSKI run on tiptoe to the place assigned.)
CHARITY COMMISSIONER. It's as you please, Ammos Fyodorovich ; but we certainly ought to make the attempt.
